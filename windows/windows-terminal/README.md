This [windows terminal profile](settings.json) has a few dependencies.

- Deluga Nerd Fonts | To get [pixel perfect fonts](https://www.thushanfernando.com/posts/2020/windows-terminal-setup/#pixel-perfect-fonts).
- GSudo | To [elevate powershell easily](https://www.thushanfernando.com/posts/2020/windows-terminal-setup/#elevate-powershell-easily).
- Environment Variables:
  - `WT_PROJECT` - Default home directory (which in my case is where my source/projects are)
