# PopOS PipeWire Loudness Normalisation

This directory contains the PipeWire configuration to normalise the audio for PopOS.

It heavily leverages the excellent work by [Guisy Digital](https://github.com/Digitalone1) who has the amazing [EasyEffects Presets](https://github.com/Digitalone1/EasyEffects-Presets) for Loudness Equalization.

* [setup-loudness-equalisation.sh](setup-loudness-equalisation.sh) - installs the above preset to an Installation of [EasyEffects](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.wwmm.easyeffects) output folder.
* [LoudnessEqualiser.json](LoudnessEqualiser.json) - my customised version.

Detailed installation and write up on [PipeWire Loudness Normalisation](https://www.thushanfernando.com/notes/popos-pipewire-loudness/) is available too.
